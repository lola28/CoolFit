        <h2>Activtiy Status Questionnaire</h2>
          <p>This Questionnaire is based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to help us better understand your current physical activity level in order to be able to give you a customized recommendation. These Questions will try and assess all the physical activities that you did in the last 7 days solely for recreation, sport, exercise or leisure.</p>
          <p>Think about all the vigorous and moderate activities that you did in the last 7 days. Vigorous physical activities refer to activities that take hard physical effort and make you breathe much harder than normal. Moderate activities refer to activities that take moderate physical effort and make you breathe somewhat harder than normal.</p>
